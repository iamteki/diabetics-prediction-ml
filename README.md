# Diabetes Prediction ML Model

This repository contains machine learning models for predicting diabetes using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest algorithms. The project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to explore and compare the performance of these two models in predicting diabetes based on various medical predictor variables.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-ml.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```sh
   cd diabetes-prediction-ml
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that `cleanedDataset.csv` is in the same directory as your Python files.

2. Run the SVM model:
   ```sh
   python SVM.py
   ```

3. Run the Random Forest model:
   ```sh
   python "Random Forrest.py"
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The dataset included in this repository (`cleanedDataset.csv`) has been preprocessed for use with the machine learning models.

## Models

- **SVM**: Support Vector Machine model for classification.
- **Random Forest**: Random Forest model for classification.

## Results

[Include some information about your models' performance, e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, etc.]
